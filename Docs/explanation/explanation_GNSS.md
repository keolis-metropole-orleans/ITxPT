# Explanation Test GNSS

The GNSS Test comes to retrieve the GPS data provided by the SAE server. By launching the test, we come to connect
to the UDP multicast broadcast group. This then allows the data to be recovered.

After 5 GPS data received the test ends, if it is displayed "Test Passed", it means that there were no errors.
Otherwise the test will display "Test Fail !!!"
