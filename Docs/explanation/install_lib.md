# How to install a Python library?

As a first step, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.

Logically if you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed you also have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). To check this run the following command on a terminal:
``$ pip --version``

Once this verification is done, you just have to enter the following command in a terminal:

``$ pip install name_of_librairy``

- ``pip install`` allows you to launch the installation of a library
- ``name_of_librairy`` is the name of the library you want to install

You can install your libraries in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in order to avoid potential conflicts between some libraries.
